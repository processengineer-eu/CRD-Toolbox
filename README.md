The Chemical Reactor Design Toolbox is a custom library for the
MATLAB/SIMSCAPE framework consisting of basic blocks. 

Was kann ich damit machen?

Each block
represents either a balancing control volume, a physical transport
process (for mass, heat and momentum), a source/sink due to a chemical
reaction or a thermodynamic phase equilibrium. A multicomponent
mixture of an arbitrary number of individual species is considered in
each phase (gas, solid, liquid and interface).

By combining several basic blocks into subsystems composite blocks can
be defined. Iteratively applied, hierarchical multi-scale models can
be created from scratch without the need of writing a single line of
code (no-code programming).
