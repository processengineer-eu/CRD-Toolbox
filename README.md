## Motivation

A fundamental knowledge and a basic understanding of the interactions
between chemical reactions and various transport processes is
essential for a proper design of chemical reactors and related
processes. However, presenting those fundamentals in the classroom has
been difficult to motivate the students to rise to the
challenges. Therefore, the Chemical Reactor Design Toolbox was
developed to provide a tool to address the challenge through an
innovative, creative and playful approach.

## Description

This toolbox is implemented as a custom library for the
MATLAB&reg;/Simscape&reg; framework consisting of basic blocks. Each
block represents either a balancing control volume, a physical
transport process (for mass, heat and momentum), a source/sink due to
a chemical reaction or a thermodynamic phase equilibrium. A
multicomponent mixture of an arbitrary number of individual species is
considered in each phase (gas, solid, liquid and interface). By
combining several basic blocks into subsystems composite blocks can be
defined. Iteratively applied, hierarchical multi-scale models can be
created from scratch without the need of writing a single line of code
(no-code programming).

## Application

The toolbox has been successfully applied in the last years at our
university in chemical engineering, biochemical reaction engineering,
and electrochemical reaction engineering courses. In addition, digital
twins of actual experimental setups have been created to provide a
quasi hands-on experience for the students to train their experimental
skills without the need of placing expensive laboratory equipment at
their disposal.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains all component files for all four domains
together with a set of helper scripts.

## Installation
